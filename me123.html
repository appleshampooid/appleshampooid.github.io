<Blockquote>This is the webpage for our ME123 project / competition.  It is where we will describe the models and processes we used to simulate the competition.  The webpage is divided in to four main parts:
<ul><li><a href="desc.html">Detailed project description</a></li>
<LI><a href="team.html">All about our team</a></li>
<li><a href="matlab.html">Matlab simulation</a></li>
<li><a href="wm.html">Working Model simulation</a></li></ul>
All of the other pages on the site will have a navigation bar similar to the one at the bottom of this page, so you can get to any of the main pages no matter where you are.
<P align="center"><font size="-1">All of the pages on our site were authored by Nick Philbrook, unless otherwise specified</font></p>
