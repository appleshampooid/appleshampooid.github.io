Location: ME123 Classroom<BR>
Present: Ben Frevert, Nicholas Philbrook, Joe Dixon<BR>
<BR>
First we talked about the team homework that is supposed to be due today.  Ben had the best handle on it, with some good plots.<BR>
<BR>
Then we talked about the project: what exactly we're going to have to do, and what kind of stuff we're going to be given for it.<BR>
<BR>
Joe and Ben compared k/m values from the previous homework.<BR>
<BR>
Then we worked on the calculation for the coefficient of restitution.<BR>
<BR>
For the high_angle movie Ben got e = 0.470588<BR>
And for the low_angle he got e = 0.52424<BR>
At this point the class period was over, and we made plans to continue our work later<BR>
