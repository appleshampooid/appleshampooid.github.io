Location: Worx<br>
Present: Ben Frevert, Nicholas Philbrook, Joe Dixon<BR>
<BR>
We examined what kind of work we had done up to this point, and decided on a divide and conquer approach:<br>
<UL><LI>Ben has pretty good Matlab code from the previous homeworks, so he is going to be the main Matlab guy</li>
<LI>Joe has a pretty good Working Model simulation going, so he is going to be the main Working Model guy</li>
<LI>Nick is good at the HTML stuff, so he is going to be the main webpage guru</li></ul>
<BR>
Then we talked about the project: what exactly we're going to have to do, and what kind of stuff we're going to be given for it.  Inputs and outputs, etc.<BR>
<BR>We examined the grading rubric from the website and also the competition rules to get any constants / givens that we hadn't noticed yet<BR>
