<blockquote>Working Model is a powerful 2-D modelling software package that allows you to place objects on the screen, describe their properties, and control environmental variables such as gravity and air resistance.  Like Matlab, we learned about Working Model by doing homework assignments during the quarter, which prepared us for modelling the competition project.<BR><BR>
