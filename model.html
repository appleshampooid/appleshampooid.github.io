<blockquote>
Before the program is started, we can insert the distance to the hole, which is then calculated by Matlab to find which angle we should release the arm from.  When the arm is released, it goes into a swinging motion making contact with the ball at the tee.  During the impact, Working Model calculates the elasticity of the collision through our coefficient of restitution which was inserted as the ball's elasticity.  After the impact, the ball will fly through the air, where we used our k/m value to get the air resistance coefficient.  Hopefully, if all goes well and all our calculations are correct, the ball should land in the hole.
